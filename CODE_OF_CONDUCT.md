# BONA FIDE CODE OF CONDUCT

Version 2.1.0 

This community encourages contributions from anyone, regardless of any demographic characteristic and political views. We ask all contributors to make a conscious effort to communicate in ways that avoid practices that will predictably and unnecessarily risk putting some contributors off.

## Guidelines

*  Please assume all other participants are posting in good faith with the implicit purpose to help our community;
*  Call other participants by the names they use, and honor their preferences about their gender identity;
*  Don't make personal attacks against other participants. If you need to be critical, please underline that you are criticizing a statement, not a person;
*  Let's not raise politics other than software and web freedoms, and basic human rights;
*  Please abstain from contributing to vicious circles of escalating verbal aggression. A private response - politely stating your feelings as feelings and asking for peace - may calm things down;
*  Please be kind to other contributors when saying they made a mistake, as nobody is infallible;
*  Please respond only to what people actually said with objectivity and self-control;
*  Brief off-topic is acceptable, but please try to keep the overall discussion on-topic;
*  Rather than trying to have the last word, look for the times when there is no need to reply because your comment won’t add any new useful information;
*  Internet is not be the best way to transmit emotions, so please don't hold a grudge against your peers.

By making an effort to follow these guidelines, our discussions will be friendlier and reach conclusions more easily. The consequences for repeatedly violating these guidelines will be:

1.  A friendly warning;
2.  Temporary loss of the write access to our services (mute);
3. Temporary loss of both read and write access to our services (ban).

We don’t like applying penalties and we believe people can change over time and then return to participate again with renewed politeness.

Inspired by Richard Stallman's GNU Kind Communications Guidelines.
